# Portfolio Draft

### Skills

- I'm skilled in Go, TypeScript and Bash.
    - Go is very powerful for backend and tooling development.
    - TypeScript is very widely used for frontend development.
    - Bash is useful for scripting and automation.
- These skillsets are very useful for building web applications and
  command-line tools for open source or internal use.

### Experiences

- I was a 2-time Google intern.
    - 1st internship: I worked on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
      Kubernetes Engine (GKE) team.
        - I was responsible for refactoring an existing Bash self-monitoring
          and debugging script into a Go binary.
        - This made the script far more reliable and easier to maintain. The
          script also translated into visible metrics accessible by on-call
          engineers which helped them debug issues faster.
    - 2nd internship: I worked on the Google Trust Services team.
        - I was responsible for reconciling our internal certificate logs
          with the public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.
        - The reconciliation pipeline is able to ingest hundreds of
          thousands of logs every second.
        - It is powered by the Apache Beam framework and runs on internal
          Google infrastructure.
        - It helped us more easily detect certificate misissuance and
          misbehavior by our Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- I have also been a self-taught open source developer for over 5 years now
  and have various large open source projects on my belt. Some of my
  projects are:
    - arikawa -- a Discord library for Go with idiomatic patterns and ease of use in mind.
      It features over 400 stars on GitHub.
    - gtkcord4 -- a Discord client for Linux written in Go and GTK4,
      written to be as responsive as a truly native GUI application.
      It features over 650 stars on GitHub.
    - Layover Party -- a website for finding flight layovers and
      match with other travelers. It won LAHacks 2022's Best Travel category.
    - acm-aws -- declarative, version-controlled Terraform deployment for
      AWS, used by our club ACM at CSUF for hosting our infrastructure.

### Interests

- I'm interested in tooling development, backend development, and
  infrastructure development.
- I'm also interested in open source development and have been a
  self-taught open source developer for over 5 years now.
- I'm also interested in distributed systems and cloud computing.

### Career Goals

- I want to work on projects that are impactful and help people.
- I want to work on open source projects that are used by many people, as I
  believe it's a way for me to give back to the community.
- I want to work on projects that are challenging and help me grow as a
  software engineer.
- I want to work on projects that are interesting and fun to work on.
